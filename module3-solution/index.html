                <p>
                    Chicken is the ubiquitous food of our era, crossing multiple cultural boundaries with ease. With its
                    mild
                    taste and uniform texture, chicken presents an intriguingly blank canvas for the flavor palette of
                    almost
                    any cuisine. A generation of Britons is coming of age in the belief that chicken tikka masala is the
                    national dish, and the same thing is happening in China with Kentucky Fried Chicken. Long after the
                    time
                    when most families had a few hens running around the yard that could be grabbed and turned into
                    dinner,
                    chicken remains a nostalgic, evocative dish for most Americans. When author Jack Canfield was
                    looking for a
                    metaphor for psychological comfort, he didn’t call it “Clam Chowder for the Soul.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    How did the chicken achieve such cultural and culinary dominance? It is all the more surprising in
                    light of
                    the belief by many archaeologists that chickens were first domesticated not for eating but for
                    cockfighting.
                    Until the advent of large-scale industrial production in the 20th century, the economic and
                    nutritional
                    contribution of chickens was modest. In Guns, Germs, and Steel, Jared Diamond listed chickens among
                    the
                    “small domestic mammals and domestic birds and insects” that have been useful to humanity but unlike
                    the
                    horse or the ox did little—outside of legends—to change the course of history. Nonetheless, the
                    chicken has
                    inspired contributions to culture, art, cuisine, science and religion over the millennia. Chickens
                    were, and
                    still are, a sacred animal in some cultures. The prodigious and ever-watchful hen was a worldwide
                    symbol of
                    nurturance and fertility. Eggs hung in Egyptian temples to ensure a bountiful river flood. The lusty
                    rooster
                    (a.k.a. cock) was a universal signifier of virility—but also, in the ancient Persian faith of
                    Zoroastrianism, a benign spirit that crowed at dawn to herald a turning point in the cosmic struggle
                    between
                    darkness and light. For the Romans, the chicken’s killer app was fortunetelling, especially during
                    wartime.
                    Chickens accompanied Roman armies, and their behavior was carefully observed before battle; a good
                    appetite
                    meant victory was likely. According to the writings of Cicero, when one contingent of birds refused
                    to eat
                    before a sea battle in 249 B.C., an angry consul threw them overboard. History records that he was
                    defeated.

                <p>
                    Beef is the culinary name for meat from bovines, especially cattle. Beef can be harvested from cows,
                    bulls,
                    heifers or steers. Acceptability as a food source varies in different parts of the world.

                    Pit beef is a dish of roast beef prepared over a charcoal fire, commonly using top round cuts of beef.
                    The
                    cooked roast is sliced thinly and often served on a Kaiser roll, accompanied by tiger sauce (horseradish
                    and
                    mayonnaise) and sliced raw onion. Unlike barbecue, the meat is cooked quickly at high temperatures,
                    served
                    rare, and has a light smoke flavor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Spiced beef (Irish: mairteoil spíosraithe) is a cured and salted joint of rump or silverside beef, which
                    is
                    traditionally served at Christmas or the New Year in Ireland, especially County Cork. It is a form of
                    salt
                    beef, cured with spices and saltpetre, and is usually boiled, broiled or semi-steamed in water, Guinness
                    (or
                    a similar stout), and then optionally roasted for a period after.

                    Sushi is the most famous Japanese dish outside of Japan and one of the most popular among Japanese, who
                    enjoy sushi on special occasions. And as such, it was evolved outside that country, influenced by
                    different
                    Western cultures, especially in USA. That is why many of the different types of sushi have denomination
                    of
                    localities of USA (California roll, New York roll, etc.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    The name of sushi is a generic name of different types, combinations of ingredients and forms of a
                    typical
                    Japanese food, and basically are made from Japanese type rice and different seafood (fresh fish, prawns,
                    seaweed etc) and vegetables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most consumed in Japan. It consists of pressing the rice in cylindrical form, and then putting a
                    thin
                    foil of raw fish on top. It is served with soy sauce to bathe the fish. Nigiri means something like
                    "hand
                    pressed". This type of sushi is the most common type at the sushi bar: A small oval made with rice, with
                    an
                    expertly cut slice of fish on top, and with a dab of wasabi on it. Most types of nigirisushi are meant
                    to be
                    dipped in soy sauce, and must be eaten in one bite, slowly. Close your eyes and feel the different
                    textures
                    in your mouth while you eat every piece.
